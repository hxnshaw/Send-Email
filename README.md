# Send-Email
This is another project in the JavaScript learning program. This project simulates sending an email, with validations enabled. It checks if the fields are empty and also if the right inputs are used as in the case of the email field. If there are errors such as empty fields, it raises an alert by displaying a red line. If all the conditions are met, each field gets a green line.
